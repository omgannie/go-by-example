## commands
* Run file: `go run xxx.go`
* Build programs into executable binaries: `go build xxx.go` then `./xxx`

## syntax basics
* can merge strings with +
* boolean operators are familiar: `&&, ||, !true`
* print with `fmt.Println('x')`
* Go will infer type of initialized variable. If variable is empty, it will be zero-valued.
